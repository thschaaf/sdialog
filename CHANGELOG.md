- **sdialog.interpretability**: 
  - Support for inspecting layer and component inputs with `Inspector(target="model.layers.15", inspect_input=True)`
  - Support for inspecting and steering input tokens (tokens given as input, not only generated ones), e.g., `inspector.input[i][j].act` where `i` is turn index and `j` is input token index
- **sdialog.config**: 
  - Support for Anthropic backend (#100)
  - Support for Azure OpenAI backend (#100)

### Fixed
- **sdialog.agents**: Agent memory reset when no prompt system and no persona is given

- **sdialog.agents**:
  - Improved `Agent` initialization so agents can act as a proxy for external conversational systems (#90, fa1d8f3)
