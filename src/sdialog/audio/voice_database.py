"""
This module provides comprehensive voice database management for the sdialog library.

The module includes a base voice database class and multiple implementations for
different data sources, enabling flexible voice selection and management for
text-to-speech generation with support for multiple languages and speaker
characteristics.

Key Components:

  - BaseVoiceDatabase: Abstract base class for voice database implementations
  - Voice: Data model for individual voice entries with metadata
  - HuggingfaceVoiceDatabase: Implementation using Hugging Face datasets
  - LocalVoiceDatabase: Implementation using local audio files and metadata
  - VoiceDatabase: Implementation using in-memory voice data

Voice Database Features:

  - Multi-language voice support with automatic language detection
  - Speaker characteristics (gender, age, language) for voice selection
  - Voice usage tracking to prevent duplicates (optional)
  - Comprehensive statistics and reporting
  - Support for various data sources (Hugging Face, local files, in-memory)
  - Flexible voice selection based on persona characteristics

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sdialog.audio import HuggingfaceVoiceDatabase, LocalVoiceDatabase

        # Initialize with Hugging Face dataset
        voice_db = HuggingfaceVoiceDatabase("sdialog/voices-libritts")

        # Get voice based on speaker characteristics
        voice = voice_db.get_voice(gender="female", age=25, lang="english", seed=42)

        # Initialize with local files
        local_db = LocalVoiceDatabase(
            directory_audios="voices/",
            metadata_file="voices/metadata.csv"
        )

        # Get statistics
        stats = voice_db.get_statistics(pretty=True)
        print(stats)
