"""
This module provides a comprehensive text-to-speech (TTS) engine framework for the sdialog library.

The module includes a base abstract class for TTS engines and concrete implementations
for various TTS models, enabling flexible audio generation from text with support
for multiple languages and voice characteristics.

Key Components:

  - BaseTTS: Abstract base class defining the TTS interface

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sdialog.audio.tts import KokoroTTS, IndexTTS, HuggingFaceTTS, ChatterboxTTS

        # Initialize Kokoro TTS for American English
        tts = KokoroTTS(lang_code="a")
        audio, sample_rate = tts.generate("Hello world", voice="am_echo")

        # Initialize IndexTTS for bilingual support
        tts = IndexTTS(model_dir="model", cfg_path="model/config.yaml")
        audio, sample_rate = tts.generate("你好世界", voice="chinese_voice")

        # Initialize HuggingFaceTTS for facebook/mms-tts-eng model
        tts = HuggingFaceTTS(model_id="facebook/mms-tts-eng")
        audio, sample_rate = tts.generate("[clears throat] This is a test ...")

        # Initialize ChatterboxTTS with voice cloning
        tts = ChatterboxTTS(device="auto")
        tts.register_voice("MyVoice", "./my_voice_sample.wav")
        audio, sample_rate = tts.generate("Hello with cloned voice", voice="MyVoice")

class BaseTTS(ABC):

    Abstract base class for text-to-speech (TTS) engines.

    This class defines the interface that all TTS engine implementations must follow.
    It provides a common structure for initializing TTS pipelines and generating
    audio from text input with specified voice characteristics.

    Subclasses must implement the generate() method to provide the actual
    TTS functionality. The pipeline attribute should be initialized in the
    subclass constructor with the appropriate TTS model or pipeline.

    Key Features:

      - Abstract interface for TTS engine implementations
      - Common initialization pattern for TTS pipelines
      - Standardized audio generation interface
      - Support for voice-specific audio generation
