    IndexTTS engine implementation using the IndexTTS model.

    IndexTTS is a bilingual text-to-speech engine that supports both Chinese
    and English languages with automatic language detection. It provides
    high-quality speech synthesis with natural prosody and pronunciation
    for both languages.

    Key Features:
        - Bilingual support (Chinese and English)
        - Automatic language detection from text input
        - High-quality speech synthesis
        - GPU acceleration support
        - Flexible model configuration
